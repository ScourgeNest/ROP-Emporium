## 📌 About

ROP Emporium provides a series of challenges designed to teach the fundamentals of **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** and binary exploitation.  
The exercises gradually increase in difficulty and cover essential exploitation concepts.  

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

- ✅ **Exploit scripts** – Python scripts using `pwntools` for automation  
- ✅ **Step-by-step write-ups** – Detailed explanations of the exploitation process  
- ✅ **Binary analysis notes** – Insights from `checksec`, `nm`, `radare2`, and Ghidra  
- ✅ **ROP chains** – How gadgets are combined to bypass protections and achieve code execution  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By following these solutions, you will learn to:  
- Understand and identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities  
- Analyze binary protections with `checksec`  
- Locate writable memory sections (`.bss`, `.data`)  
- Find and chain useful ROP gadgets  
- Handle **bad characters** and encode payloads  
- Craft payloads to call functions with controlled arguments

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository serves as:  
- A **personal study resource** for mastering binary exploitation  
- A **reference guide** for students and CTF players learning ROP  
- A **documentation hub** that explains not just the “how”, but also the “why” behind each exploit
